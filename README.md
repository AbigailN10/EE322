## Engineering Design VI

### Welcome to my GitHub for Design 6
This is my **first time** using Github so I am excited to *learn* about it this semester! As Kevin Lu said in class, > "Never stop learning"
![I already learned that the Github logo is an Octocat](https://images.app.goo.gl/b33yuvTHGkypijTb6)

What I hope to learn this semester:
1. Raspberry Pi
2. Github
3. Python
4. IoT
