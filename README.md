## Engineering Design VI

### Welcome to my GitHub for Design 6
This is my **first time** using Github so I am excited to learn about it this semester! As Kevin Lu said in class, >"Never stop learning"

What I hope to learn this semester:
1. Raspberry Pi
2. Github
3. Python
4. IoT

I have already learned some basic syntax in Github! For instance, how to *italicise text*.
